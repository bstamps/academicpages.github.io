Microbial life is all around us
======
Yet manytimes we pass by it without a second thought, especially in the world we've built around us. My research attempts to understand _how_ and _if_ some of the microbes in our built environment are actually tearing it down. 

To do this, I use microorganisms isolated from across the built environment, even those we've found living within the International Space Station. Working at the intersection of materials science, engineering, and microbiology is an exciting place to be- I hope that my work can inform on processes of corrosion and biodegradation, and inspire my engineer colleagues to develop novel materials or methods of mitigation. 

Where I work
------
I currently reside in the hub of the universe- Golden, Colorado! We're a small town near the foothills of the Colorado front range near Denver. Specifically, I work within the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. 



A data-driven professional website
------
The idea of this site is to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a home not only for my workflows used in publication, but as a home and repository for all of my work. I hope that this page will inspire you as a non-computer programmer, and let you know that even a microbiologist can have a versioned, well put together home page!
