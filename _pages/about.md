Welcome to my page! This site is currently under revision, but is the home of who I am professionally. 




Who I Am
======
Microbial life is all around, above, and below usâ€¦ and we need to get out and study it!

I graduated from The University of Oklahoma (OU) in 2011 with a B.Sc. in Microbiology. After graduating I decided to stay at OU with my undergraduate advisor Bradley Stevenson working on a diverse set of projects. My focus was on applying high throughput DNA sequencing to engineered ecosystems- From landfills to biodiesel storage tanks exibiting varying degrees of fouling at several Air Force sites. Starting in the summer of 2013 I also instructed students at the USC International Geobiology Course in microbial ecology and bioinformatics.

Where I work
------
I currently reside in the Hub of the universe- Golden, Colorado! We're a small town near the foothills of the Colorado front range. Specifically, I work within the Civil and Environmental Engineering department at the Colorado School of Mines. 

A data-driven professional website
======
The idea of this site is to use [GitHub](https://github.com/) as a home not only for my workflows used in publication, but as a home and repository for all of my work. I hope that this page will inspire you as a non-computer programmer, and let you know that even a microbiologist can have a versioned, well put together home page!
