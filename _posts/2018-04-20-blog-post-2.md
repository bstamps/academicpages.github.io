Getting your web presence established can be difficult. I've tried a few different ways over the years, from Research Gate, to Linkedin, finally ending up with a Wordpress blog. But, I felt as though the site was lacking- both in form and usability. 

I have more to talk about as my path in academia moves forward, both in my research and my teaching. Expect to see some of my thoughts on R, Software Carpentry, and reproducible research here. 


Enter GitHub

A few years ago I found the [Academic Pages GitHub.io](https://academicpages.github.io/). I enjoy how clean the page looks, and decided to give it a shot. After which I promptly abandoned the page. Markdown syntax looked scary, and with a pending dissertation to turn in I dropped it. Moving further along into my postdoc now, I decided to buckle down and give github.io another shot. 

Transparency in research is critical, and I think this can extend even to our web sites. By using github.io, and forking an active repository made for academics I feel that even our professional web pages can be a part of this process. So check out my repository, or make your own page from [here](https://academicpages.github.io/).
